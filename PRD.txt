### Product Requirements Document (PRD) v2

### **1. Problem**

The Sales team often finds it hard to get the best rates to charge a client for Trucking services between locations (origin and destination). Currently, they ask the fleet manager, who pulls information from a csv sheet and shares with them in chat.This process is inefficient, time-consuming, and disrupts workflow, leading to delays in providing quotes to clients.

### **2. Solution**

Develop a **Trip Rate tool**  that provides easy access to cost and sales information for the sales team. 

The tool will allow users to review existing data based on **Origin** and **Destination** and can help calculate costs dynamically. Default values will be prefilled based on the most recently uploaded data but can be adjusted by users.

A file containing the following headers will serve as the starting dataset:

- **Origin**
- **Destination**
- **Road Expenses**
- **Dispatch**
- **Fuel Cost**
- **Cost/Litre**
- **Litres**
- **Trip Rate**
- **Commission**
- **Charges**

This data will be uploaded as knowledge, and to an external database that will have an API integration.

### User inputs for rates

1. **Input Fields**
    - **Origin** and **Destination** (searchable fields to retrieve existing data).
    - **Editable Fields**:
        - Road Expenses
        - Dispatch Fees

        - Fuel Litres (defaulted to the last used value from the upload).
        - Charges (Revenue).
    - Commission Percentage (adjustable).
2.  **Calculations**
    - **Fuel Cost**: calculated as `Fuel Price (Cost/Litre) * Fuel Litres`.
    - **Total Costs**: Sum of Road Expenses, Dispatch Fees, Fuel Cost, and Commission amount.
    - **Profit**: calculated as `Charges - Total Costs`.
3. **Database Integration**
    - Users can upload files with predefined headers to serve as the dataset.
    - Default starting values for fields like Litres will be pulled from the last uploaded data.
    - Ability to update values, add new rates, or overwrite data via file upload.
4. **User Interaction**
    - Optimize for Searching functionality to find rates based on **Origin** and **Destination**.
